# Improvements-on-SchNet
This is a improvement on SchNet, a neural network for presice molescule structure prediction.
The innovation points are as follows:
1. Deepen the MLP with ResNet of Vertices Updating, which is benefitial of dealing with more complicated molescules.
2. Add more Physical Law, rendering the model to better match the real situation.
3. Use LeakyReLU as activation function in order to avoid gradient vanishing.
